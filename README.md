This is my attempt you can clone the repo, run npm I, and then npm run dev to run the project locally

Besides this, I have deployed this project on Vercel, so you can visit the link: https://greyball-ecommerce-nu.vercel.app/

Please note the:

1. Latest nextJS version is used
2. I have created a sample JSON and then imported it to the Firebase real-time database as a mock backend
3. Typescript is used.
4. The same provided product list structure is used.
5. The product listing page that displays the fetched product data is in a grid layout. Each
product card should include the Product image, name, description(truncated up to 100 chars), price(formatted), and rating.
6. Implement pagination for the product listing. The initial page displays only 10 products and the user can interact with the page for more data, next and previous pages.
7. The real-time search is implemented.
8. Sorting(rating and price) functionality is implemented.
9. The user can add the products to the card, and the cart items and total price are displayed in the fixed header, A cart modal has been developed to review/increase/decrease the quantity of products.
10. The Redux toolkit is used for overall state management.
11. The design is responsive and I use the tailwind CSS.
12. I will provide a Git link also the project is deployed on Vercel https://greyball-ecommerce-nu.vercel.app/
